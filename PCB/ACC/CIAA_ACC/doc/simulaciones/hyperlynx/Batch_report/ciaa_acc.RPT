CROSSTALK REPORT - QUICK ANALYSIS
**********************************************************************
  The following crosstalk information is intended to be worst case
  estimates assuming all nets are unterminated.  Actual driver rise
  and fall times have been used for the estimates where models were
  found.  The HyperLynx field solver and equation-based estimates have
  been combined with an expert system to compute peak crosstalk
  magnitudes.  The crosstalk values are the sum of crosstalk from each
  segment for each electrically connected set of associated nets.
  Although these estimates are more accurate than can be calculated
  manually using closed-form equations, they are estimates only.  Run
  detailed simulations to find actual crosstalk levels.  These
  estimates are useful for determining which nets to simulate in
  detail.
